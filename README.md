# Elmot's Fluent API Add-on for Vaadin 8

Yet another [Fluent API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) addon 
for [Vaadin 8](https://vaadin.com/framework). Uses approach without extending 
existing classes but by encapsulating those to outer classes. As a result, the 
API looks a bit like [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) pattern. 
Note ```get()``` method in the example.  

## Getting started

```java
Label label = Fluent.label()
                        .value("Styled label")
                        .styles(ValoTheme.LABEL_HUGE, ValoTheme.LABEL_COLORED)
                        .get();
```
I do not see a point in covering all the Vaadin components with fluents but only most 
used components without complicated settings. Nevertheless, if you need to "fluent" 
some custom or complicated component, you can do that like here: 
```java
Fluent.$(new Grid()).setup(grid -> grid.setBeanType(YourBean.class)).id("grid");
```
If that is not enough for you, feel free to [contribute](#contributions).

## Developer Guide
Note, most of the code is automatically generated from java class templates. 
Do not try to manually change the result classes. all of those changes will be lost during build process.
The ``fluent-api-gen`` module contains both code generator code and java template classes:  
* [The code generator](fluent-api-gen/src/main/java/org/vaadin/addon/elmot/fluent/gen/Generator.java)
* [The templates](fluent-api-gen/src/main/java/org/vaadin/addon/elmot/fluent/templates/impl) 

Method return types, some annotations, trivial methods implementations, overriden 
methods are added automatically by the code generator.
